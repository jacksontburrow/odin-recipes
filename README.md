# odin-recipes
In this project I created a simple website that has a homepage that lists available recipes linked to three additional pages with those three recipes. 

Recipes included: meatloaf, turkey chili, and homemade biscuits

Knowledge demonstrated by the completion of this project includes: construction of basic html code (boilerplate), use of links (both relative and absolute), use of images, use of lists (undordered and ordered), and use of headings.
